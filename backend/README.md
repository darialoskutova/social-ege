# Social EGE backend

Minimal private API for the first infrastructure stage. It intentionally
contains only a database-backed health check. Authentication, student data and
test scoring are separate later stages.

## Configuration

The production file is `/opt/social-ege/backend/.env`. It must never be copied
to Git or printed in logs. Keep it owned by `daria` with mode `0600`.

`.env.example` documents variable names only:

- `HOST` must remain `127.0.0.1`; the process refuses any other value;
- `PORT` defaults to `3000`;
- the backend accepts either `DATABASE_URL` or the existing split variables
  `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`;
- `DATABASE_SSL=false` is appropriate for the existing localhost connection.

## Install and run

```sh
npm ci --omit=dev
npm start
```

Direct health check:

```sh
curl --fail-with-body http://127.0.0.1:3000/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{"ok":true}
```

The health endpoint executes `SELECT 1`, so HTTP 200 confirms both the Express
process and the configured PostgreSQL connection. It returns HTTP 503 without
database error details when PostgreSQL is unavailable.

## Current boundary

This stage does not implement login, sessions, progress, homework uploads or
test scoring. In particular, `data/tests-score-hashes.js` remains an identified
security issue and must later be replaced by server-side scoring without
shipping answer keys to browsers.
